# SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITE Contributing Guide

### Imposter Syndrome Disclaimer (Must Read)
We want your help. No really, we do.

There might be a little voice inside that tells you you’re not ready; that you need to do one more tutorial, or learn another framework, or write a few more blog posts before you can help with this project.

I assure you, that’s not the case.

This document contains some contribution guidelines and best practices, but if you don’t get it right the first time we’ll try to help you fix it.

The contribution guidelines outline the process that you’ll need to follow to get a patch merged. By making expectations and process explicit, we hope it will make it easier for you to contribute.

And you don’t just have to write code. You can help out by writing documentation, tests, or even by giving feedback about this work. (And yes, that includes giving feedback about the contribution guidelines.)

Thank you for contributing! Have a great time!

### Contribution Workflow
1) First for every issue that you are going to be working on create a new branch by using `git branch -b <new-branch-name>`.
2) Now make the changes that you need to do, and test them by running the application locally and verifying them.
3) Once you feel that your work is done, commit your changes by first adding your changes using `git add .` then with `git commit -m "<enter-commit-message>"` you can commit your changes, and finally `git push origin <branch-name>` will push your changes from you local to your fork of the repository, from there you can then open a PR (Pull Request) for merging.
